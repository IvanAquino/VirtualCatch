# Hello Developers!

I am working on this application because I want to make applications that incentivize exercise. As a developer I work on things that are not always obviously morally good. Improving public health through exercise by making a **free application available on the web** for anyone without any special equipment besides a webcam. Feel free to reach out or submit a pull request if you want to contribute.

# Technologies Used
* Tensorflow.js
* Three.js
* TypeScript
* Parcel Bundler

# Current Features
* Different Pitching Speeds (Up/Down arrow key)
* Detect collisions with both hands
* BETA: Fullscreen Left/Right arrow key. Have to solve resizing for this to work

# Future Features
* Gloves rotate with your hands
* Multiplayer Catch
* Implement Resizing
* Pitching area fits full screen
* Curve balls and fast balls
* Get fullscreen to work (Left/Right arrow key. It throws off the ratio)
* Don't just detect hand collisions, detect body collisions
* Calculate distance from Camera for true 3d catch detection
* Performance optimizations for lower power machines

# Compatability
I am developing on a 2015 15 inch MBP and know it works in Chrome. Would be nice for people to check it on different devices and platforms
