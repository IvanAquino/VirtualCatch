# Hello Developers!

I am working on this application because I really like making applications that get people to exercise. As a developer I work on things that are not always obviously morally good. Improving public health by making a **free application available on the web** for anyone without any special equipment besides a webcam is good. Feel free to reach out or submit a pull request if you want to contribute. You can also reach out to me and send me a message!


# Technologies Used
* Tensorflow.js
* Three.js
* TypeScript
* Parcel Bundler

# Current Features
* Different Pitching Speeds (Up/Down arrow key)
* Detect collisions with both hands

# Future Features
* Gloves rotate with your hands
* Multiplayer Catch
* Pitching area fits full screen
* Curve balls and fast balls
* Gloves rotate with your handsGet fullscreen to work (Left/Right arrow key. It throws off the ratio)
* Don't just detect hand collisions, detect body collisions
* Calculate distance from Camera for true 3d catch detection
* Performance optimizations for lower power machines

# Compatability
I am developing on a 2015 15 inch MBP and know it works in Chrome. Would be nice for people to check it on different devices and platforms
